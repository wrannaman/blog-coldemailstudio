# Persona

* They want to explore using it to increase engagement of students and employers

**What are the goals of the site?**

* Will this tool create engagement in a way that zoom and other platforms do not

**What is the age of your person?**

* 30's / 40's and up - hard to say rn.

**What is the gender of your person?**

* Couldn’t find this. Will know once we gather the list.
* Women

**What is the highest level of education this person has received?**

* 50% bachelors 30% masters

**Professional** **How much work experience does your person have?**

* 3-5 years

**What is your person’s professional background?**

* other academic institutions

**Why will they come to the site? (User needs, interests, and goals)**

* To discover if there's a new way they can better (or uniquely) engage students, alumni, and employers. Likely through events.

**Where (or from whom) else is this person getting information about your issue or similar programs or services?**

* referrals from students, searching

**When and where will users access the site? (User environment and context)**

* web and mobile app.

**Technical** **What technological devices does your person use on a regular basis?**

* phone / computer

* DegreeWorks, Tableau online student databases (e.g., SIS, PeopleSoft, Banner). Microsoft Office Suite including Word, Excel, Power Point, Outlook.

* Knowledge workers. Probably most of the day like the rest of us.

**User Motivation What is your person motivated by?**

* happy students? Do they just want to keep their job? What are they looking for? - What is your person looking to do? - increase engagement. Make the career center provide real value through connections and opportunities

**What are his/her needs?**

* My sense is there’s a lot of pressure on them right now due to covid to keep relationships up and find novel ways to provide value to their students and prospective employers.

# Ideas

* Reach out to students employed in career services.

  * super high engagement rate (likely)
  * low buying power (but can evangelize or direct you to the right person with a warm intro)
  * Downside: hard to find?
* Reach out directly to above job titles.

  * Options

    * Ask for advice (hi, we're new and we want your advice on what we're doing. Free meeting room for your next event?)
    * Show them other universities are having success with this.
    * Show them how students at that university are already using <company>.

# Email Options

(Choose 2)

## **Chosen: A + C**

## **Option A:**

**Thesis**: “Educational Sale - just ask for interest”

**Subject** **Options**:

* How CU is engaging students during COVID
* A creative way to engage students and employers
* We have Zoom fatigue too...

**Body**:

Hi <name>,

I’m X from Y, and we’ve been helping career centers at universities across the country get the student engagement that Zoom and other platforms just aren’t providing.

We think one of the reasons it’s been so helpful is the flexibility for you to still be creative about the ways in which you engage students and employers. We think it’s all about 1-on-1 interactions.

We were recently featured in [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/grace-hopper-celebration-postpones-career-fair-for-women-in-tech-2020-10) when a 30,000 person conference for women in tech used us to successfully hold their recruiting event.

We also helped CU use it for a variety of events. They’ve successfully done happy hours, networking events, recruiting events, and even a virtual city trek.

If this sounds interesting, I’d love to introduce you to our CEO, XXX, and see if we can help you bring your ideas to life.

Thanks,

X

Hi <name>,

It's X from Y. Just following up to see if you had a chance to take a look at the [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/grace-hopper-celebration-postpones-career-fair-for-women-in-tech-2020-10) article describing how a 30,000 person conference for women in tech used us to successfully hold their recruiting event.

If this sounds interesting, I’d love to introduce you to our CEO, XXX and see if we can help you increase engagement.

Thanks,

X

**FU #2:**

Hi <name>,

It’s X from Y. We’ve been helping other universities increase engagement, and recently helped CU use it for a variety of events. They’ve successfully done happy hours, networking events, recruiting events, and even a virtual city trek.

If this sounds interesting, I’d love to introduce you to our CEO, XXX.

Thanks,

X

**FU #3:**

Hi <name>,

It’s X from Y again. Just thought I’d try one last time to see if there is any interest in learning how our unique platform is helping universities increase engagement.

Thanks,

X

## **Option B:**

**Thesis**: “Advice - humble, underdog, you’re the expert.”

**Subject Options**:

* Advice on employer engagement during COVID
* Advice on student engagement
* Thoughts on student engagement

**Body**:

Hi <name>,

I’m X from Y. We help increase student engagement through our fun 1-on-1 video platform.

We’re a young company and could really use some advice on where to take the platform next. It’s happily being used at universities across the country for networking events, recruiting events, and even a virtual city trek, but we’d like to get more expert opinions on what else we could be doing.

If that sounds interesting, I’d love to introduce you to our CEO XXX, and get your professional opinion.

Thanks,

X

## **Option C:**

**Thesis**: “The blog post - educational sale”

**Subject**:

* A 30,000 person career fair didn’t use zoom
* New article on student/employer engagement
* Thought this would be helpful for student engagement

**Body**:

Hi <Name>,

I’m X from Y. We’re a young company that just got featured in Business Insider. I thought the article might help you think of some creative ways to keep engagement high for both students and employers.

[](https://www.businessinsider.com/grace-hopper-celebration-postpones-career-fair-for-women-in-tech-2020-10)<https://www.businessinsider.com/grace-hopper-celebration-postpones-career-fair-for-women-in-tech-2020-10>

The article shows how the career fair actually cancelled their recruiting event for women because of technical difficulties. The students themselves ended up using us to organize their own successful networking event!

I’m not sure if you’re actively evaluating new platforms, but I’d love to introduce you to our CEO XXX to see if your students might enjoy it as much as the students at other universities currently using us.

Thanks,

X

# Insights:

* these particular .edu domains can sometimes cause the bounce rate from tools like mixmax and others to go up, but the emails don't actually bounce. There seems to be some unique security settings for universities that make it hard to validate email addresses.
