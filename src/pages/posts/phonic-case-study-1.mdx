# Email Options

(Choose 2) Chose A & B

## **Option A:**

**Thesis**: Awareness - they don’t know this is possible

**Subject** **Options**:

* Top University Researchers Are Switching Tools
* New High Resolution Survey Tool
* New Voice + Audio Survey Tool

**Body**:

Hi {name},

I’m X from Y. We’re building a next generation survey tool that lets survey respondents use voice + video instead of just text.

I’m sure you’ve picked your tools for your current project, but I wanted to make you aware of this new tool for next time. We already have researchers from several top institutions (Stanford, Cornell, etc.) using us to get higher resolution responses.

If you’re still exploring options, I’d love to introduce you to our CEO, David Ferris to talk to you a bit more about it.

Thanks,

X

### FU #1:

Hi {name},

It’s X from Y. Just thought I’d follow up and share this article from our blog with you.

{link}

It may help you visualize how much better your survey results could be with us.

Thanks,

X

### FU #2:

Hi {name},

It’s X from Y. Another reason researchers have been switching to us is as a way to differentiate themselves from the current state of the art. Sometimes interesting results require a little risk taking but based on the results we’ve seen, it’s well worth taking the chance on a new tool.

Can I introduce you to our CEO, David Ferris to talk to you a bit more about it?

Thanks,

X

### FU #3:

Hi {name},

It’s X from Y again. Just thought I’d try to reach out one last time. Again, I know you’ve probably already selected your tools for this project but I just wanted to make you aware of us for next time.

Thanks,

X

## **Option B:**

**Thesis**: Education - teach them something

**Subject Options**:

* How Stanford Is Getting Higher Resolution Data From Surveys
* 2.8x Longer Responses With New Survey Tool
* 1.5x More Descriptive Survey Responses
* How High Resolution Data Is Helping Researchers

**Body**:

Hi {name},

I’m X from Y. We’re building a next generation voice + video first survey tool.

I wanted to share some of the insights we’ve found after researchers from top institutions like Stanford and Cornell used our tool for their research.

* Richer qualitative data points from voice + video (like sentiment analysis) has provided a deeper level of insight compared to text only.
* Longer responses (**2.8x longer**). On average, we’ve found respondents give more data per question compared to text based answers only.
* Points of leverage (**1.5x more descriptive words**). The researchers felt like they got better results overall compared to a traditional, more transactional survey.

Even if you’re not actively evaluating tools right now, I’d love to introduce you to our CEO David Ferris to talk about future projects if this sounds interesting.

Thanks,

X

## **Option C:**

**Thesis**: Advice - we want to make an amazing research tool. Can we get your thoughts? Humble - you’re the expert. Have you ever talked to a Gartner analyst? They love giving their opinion.

**Subject**:

* Advice on our voice + video survey tool
* Advice for new survey platform (voice + video)
* Advice On Survey Tools

**Body**:

Hi {name},

I’m X from Y. We’re building a next generation voice + video first survey tool that's been getting traction among researchers at top institutions like Stanford and Cornell.

As a professional, I’d love to hear your thoughts on what we’re working on. We want to make this tool as valuable as possible and the way we do that is by talking to experts like yourself. A smaller version of the work you do.

If you’re open to it, I’d love to introduce you to our CEO, David Ferris and speak with him to get your thoughts.

Thanks,

X
