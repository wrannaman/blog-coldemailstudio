> This YC company makes software for self storage facilities.



This is a case where business owners (the target) do not have much of an online presence. Their websites are often low quality and they also typically only have a generic, catch-all email address for the business. They're very difficult to reach through cold email. Long term, this is likely not a viable channel. 

# Targets

Job titles we’re going after

* Little different here. These are low tech storage unit owners. Not even sure where to find these guys yet.
* Storage unit owner
* owner/operator
* Principal owner

# Persona

Who are these people?

These are independent owner/operators. They are more traditional smb business owners. They’re low tech, keep a keen eye on cashflow, and often times if they just have one facility, they’re not as profitable as they’d like to be. They’re not the high end real estate investors with hundreds of these. Sometimes it’s a family business, other times it’s something they’ve acquired.

This is sometimes not their primary income stream and may be a kind of “side hustle”. They like to “set it and forget it”. Their current software limits their ability to automate and control costs.
