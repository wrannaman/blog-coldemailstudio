Hi X,

I’m Anna from X. We make a modern benefits platform that’s built to accommodate companies planning to WFH through 2021.

I just wanted to introduce myself and see if you’re planning on any changes for 2021 benefits. We have some amazing mental health and parental support options like Outschool, Calm, and Talkspace.

The platform is very flexible and we specialize in working around your current benefits to maximize employee satisfaction without additional administrative overhead.

Are you guys planning to WFH through 2021?

Thanks,

Anna

### FU #1:

Hi ,

Is there a better time I can reach back out to you?

Thanks,

Anna

### FU #2

Hi X,

One of our most loved features is the ability to combine tax-advantaged benefits and company-funded stipends on the same card.

If you’re exploring additional benefits to be better prepared for WFH in 2021, I’d love to hear what your needs are.

Thanks,

Anna

### FU #3

Hi X,

We also really shine with our mental health and parent support benefits. If you’re looking to add some perks for next year I’d love to hear what your needs are.

Thanks,

Anna

## **Option B:**

**Thesis**: Education

**Subject Options**:

* Trending WFH Benefits
* WFH Benefits Trends for 2021

**Body**:

Hi X,

I’m Anna from X. We make a modern benefits platform that’s built to accommodate companies planning to WFH through 2021.

I just thought I’d introduce myself and share some of the trends we’re seeing:

* A focus on tactile parenting. Trying to work 8 hours with a young child in school is nearly impossible without the right help and tools. We have 10+
* Several mental health app choices. Employees have requested they have more options available to them specifically for the mental health app of their choice. We have over 12 of them!
* WFH setup. Having a great WFH setup can make all the difference for employee productivity and happiness. This was more requested for people living in larger cities without a spare bedroom to set up as a dedicated office.

If you’re starting to explore employee benefits for 2021, I’d love to give you some more info on us and see if we can help.

Thanks,

Anna

## **Option C:**

**Thesis**: Advice

**Subject**:

* Advice on WFH Benefits
* Advice On Wellness Benefits

**Body**:

Hi X,

I’m Anna from X. 2020 has been a trying year for everyone but particularly for employers trying to keep employees happy while adapting to (or making up!) a remote culture.

We’re trying to make that a little easier for you with our benefits platform. We have a number of amazing mental health and parent support options but we’re evaluating what to add next and could use some advice.

What are some of the benefits you feel like other providers are missing?

If nothing comes to mind, what are the most used benefits within your organization?

Thanks,

Anna.

Hi X,

One of our most loved features is the ability to combine tax-advantaged benefits and company-funded stipends on the same card.

Would love to hear your thoughts.

Thanks,

Anna

### FU #3

Hi X,

I’d love to hear your thoughts on our modern benefits platform. I could even just send a few questions over via email if that would be easier!

Thanks,

Anna
