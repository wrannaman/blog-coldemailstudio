#What's the right call to action for a cold email?

**Answer:** Ask for interest. 

If this is your first time reaching out to a prospect (i.e. cold email) then you should just ask if they're interested. 

It's a lightweight way to avoid spam. It's easy to be genuine. It's not pushy, and the ask is clear. 

It's also relationship focused. "Do you want to buy this?" doesn't leave much room for a relationship. It's transactional. That's not what you want, especially with your early customers. 

You want the relationship. These are the people that are going to be actually using your product to do something. They're going to pay your for it, AND they're going to tell you what they want built! That's a good deal for you. 

Don't blow it trying to close. There may be a point in your future when you have a handful of BDRs that can close, all day. For now, value the relationship. Understand that a gem of a customer insight is just as valuable as a sale.
